Instead of using angularJS to make a responsive and easy-to-use portfolio, I am using JQuery and GASP. The main purpose of this is to make a portfolio that a user does not have to know about any programming languages. The user only need to fill out a JSON file, and all his information will be automatically synchronized and displayed in html format beautifully. 

RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Used Jquery to parse JSON object to be displayed on html in a beautiful format.
- Experimented with ScrollMagic plugins.


Programming languages used:
- Javascript, JQuery, CSS, HTML

Grunt used:
- Grunt, Jshint, uglify
